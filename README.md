# AI optimization

The project comprises various algorithmic solutions for the TSP, aimed at highlighting differences 
in terms of accuracy, performance, and flexibility. The list of implemented algorithms includes:

- `MIP.R` - A precise solution based on the Mixed Integer Programming approach.
- `Concorde.R` - Not an algorithm itself, but a script to generate precise solutions using the best-of-breed algorithm Concorde.
- `2opt_sim_anneal.R` - Implements nearest-neighbor, 2-opt, and simulated annealing heuristics to solve the TSP.
- `Crisofides.R` - A prominent approximation algorithm for the TSP based on graph theory.
- `pointer_net.R` - Neural network based on Bahdanau Attention Mechanism.
- `Q-learning.R` - Table-based reinforcement Q-learning algorithm. 
- `DQN.R` - Literally, the Deep Q-learning algorithm, which has turned out to be quite effective.
